## There are 4 modules in this virtual experience programme
‚ô¶ Project Understanding

‚ô¶ Client Presentation

## Task 1 - Project Understanding

As a data analyst, I acted as a bridge between the business and the data. I worked under the guidance of Mae Mulligan, an Accenture Managing Director, who was the client lead for Social Buzz. Social Buzz, our client, faced challenges in handling massive data due to rapid growth. 
Accenture was tasked with:
- Conducting an audit of big data practices
- Providing recommendations for an IPO
- Analyzing popular content
My specific task was to analyze sample datasets and visualize the popularity of different content categories, identifying the top 5 categories with the largest popularity.
About Client : Social Buzz

## Task 2 - Data Cleaning and Modelling

To address the business question of determining the top 5 popular content categories, I identified and worked with the following datasets:
- Reaction Score (quantifying popularity)
- Content ID
- Reaction Types
- Content Type
- Category
  
I cleaned the data by:
- Removing rows with missing values
- Changing the data type of some values within columns
- Removing irrelevant columns
  
Next, I created a final dataset by merging the three cleaned tables. This resulted in one comprehensive spreadsheet that highlighted the top 5 content categories by popularity.

## Task 3 - Data Visualization and Storytelling
I prepared a PowerPoint presentation using the given template, incorporating various charts such as:
- Pie Chart
- Bar Chart

This presentation was designed to effectively communicate the key insights from my analysis.

## Task 4 - Client Presentation
I presented my PowerPoint to the client, delivering insights and recommendations based on my analysis.

This virtual internship was an enriching experience that enhanced my skills in data analysis, data cleaning, modelling, and visualization, as well as in communicating insights effectively.
